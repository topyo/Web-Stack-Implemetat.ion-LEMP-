# Web Stack Implementation (LEMP Stack)
In Project 1, I implemented the LAMP Web Stack uisng AWS Cloud Services. Here is the link to project 1 : https://github.com/topyo/Webstack-Implementation

In Project 2, I will be implementing the LEMP Stack using AWS Cloud Services. This project follows similar concept as Project 1.

## What is a LEMP?
LEMP is a deviation of the ubiquitary LAMP stack. It is used for developing and deploying web applications. Generally, LAMP consists of Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. Due to its flexibility, the components can easily be switched. With LEMP, Apache is replaced with the lightweight yet powerful Nginx.

![](Images/Nginx.png)

## LEMP Naming / Pronounciation Convention
LEMP is used due to the pronunciation for Nginx: Engine-X (en-juhn-ecks). Consider this, In English language, the article "an" is used instead of "a" for hour even though it begins with a consonant. The importance is the sound of the first letter rather than its written representation. Besides, LEMP is actually pronounceable and doesn’t sound like reciting the alphabet (LEMP, 2021). The term LEMP is an acronym that represents L for the Linux Operating system, Nginx (pronounced as engine-x, hence the E in the acronym) web server, M for MySQL database, and P for PHP scripting language.

## LEMP stands for:
## L- Linux Operating System
## E- Nginx Server
## M- MySQL Database
## P- PHP



## Linux
Linux is an open source Unix-like operating system that provides the base for the stack components, many distributions and package management systems. Two of the most commonly used Linux distributions in LEMP stacks are Debian and Ubuntu. 

## Nginx
Nginx is an open source reverse proxy server for HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP protocols. It also functions as a load balancer, HTTP cache, and web server (origin server). It has a strong focus on high concurrency, high performance and low memory usage. The HTML5 Boilerplate project has sample server configuration files to improve performance and security (LEMP, 2021)

## MySQL

MySQL is the second most widely used open source relational database management system. A community-developed fork, MariaDB, is led by the original developers. It aims to be a drop-in replacement (LEMP, 2021)

## PHP
PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development. The scripting role can also be filled with Python or Perl. Servers such as Gunicorn or uWSGI can be used in conjunction with Nginx to serve these applications (LEMP, 2021)

# LEMP Implementation using AWS 
A major prerequsite to complete this project is having an AWS account.

## AWS Account
For new users, please use the link below to create a new account 


https://aws.amazon.com/account/sign-up


For video tutorial on how to create an AWS account use the link 


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3WLJ_0hnOU.

I created my AWS account ealier and I have described the steps used in project 1. Please note that signing in into AWS using IAM user is the best practice 
 
 Documentation to show the reasons to use IAM user:  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html)

![](Images/IAM.png)

## L- Linux Operating System
The L in LEMP is Linux. This is the operating system for this stack and this will be installed by launching an EC2 instance with ubuntu as the flavor on AWS. I used the steps below to accomplish that

First I selected an Amazon Machine Image. For this project, I will be using the Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type - ami-0aee2d0182c9054ac (64-bit x86) / ami-04e842c4cdd82c62e (64-bit Arm) as the Amazon Machine Image (AMI)


![](Images/AMI.png)

Then I chose the Instance type


![](Images/Instance.png)

Lauched the EC2 

![](Images/ClickLaunch.png)

![](Images/Launch2.png)

and Finally I checked the status of the launched EC2 instance by clicking the Launch Status 


![](Images/LaunchSatus.png)

![](Images/LS.png)

#### Note 

Before a virtual server is lauched, a key pair must be generated and downloaded. A key pair consists of a public key that AWS stores, and a private key file that users store. Together, they allow users to connect to their instance securely. For Windows AMIs, the private key file is required to obtain the password used to log into the instance. For Linux AMIs, the private key file allows users to securely SSH into their instance. Amazon EC2 supports ED25519 and RSA key pair types.(Amazon, 2022).
*The key is very important- Please save the downloaded private key (.pem file) and do not share it with anyone! Connection to the server will never be possible again if it is lost!

For this project,I used my existing key pair and acknowledged that I have access to the key


![](Images/Key.png)



## Connecting to EC2 Instance
After launching the EC2 Instance on AWS, it is essential to connect to the EC2 Instance via the terminal. I used the steps below to achieve the connection.

Step 1: I typed cd Downloads into my local PC linux terminal (This command allows a change of directory to where the downloaded PEM file is saved) 

##### Command : cd~/Downloads

Step 2: I typed $ sudo chmod 0400 < downloaded private-key-name>.pem ( This command changes the permissions for the private key(.pem) file)

Note: if the permisions are not changed an error called "Bad permissions" will be displayed. The anchor tags < > means the content in the anchor needs to be replaced. For example, using the above command, I replaced the private key to the name I saved it with during the earlier download. I saved the downloaded as Privatekey1.pem that means the above command will now be

sudo chmod 0400 Privatekey1.pem

Step 3: I typed ssh -i <Your-private-key.pem> ubuntu @ EC2-Public-IP-address

![](Images/PrivateKey.png)

Note: The Public-IP-address is from the AWS EC2 instance

On the local PC linux terminal, we have the below after completing the above steps

![](Images/EC2K.png)


Following the above steps the L- Linux Operating System component is installed.

## Installing the Nginx Web Server

The next component of the stack is # E- Nginx Server

Nginx [engine x] is an HTTP and reverse proxy server, a mail proxy server, and a generic TCP/UDP proxy server, originally written by Igor Sysoev.

### How Does Nginx Work?
Nginx is built to offer low memory usage and high concurrency. Rather than creating new processes for each web request, Nginx uses an asynchronous, event-driven approach where requests are handled in a single thread. With Nginx, one master process can control multiple worker processes. The master maintains the worker processes, while the workers do the actual processing. Because Nginx is asynchronous, each request can be executed by the worker concurrently without blocking other requests.

Some common features seen in Nginx include:

Reverse proxy with caching

IPv6

Load balancing

FastCGI support with caching
 
TLS/SSL with SNI

Nginx Web Server will be used to display the web page to site visitor. The following steps were carried out to install Nginx


Step 1: Update the list of packages in package manager using the command 

sudo apt update

![](Images/apt.png)

Step 2: Run Nginx package installation with command 

sudo apt install nginx

![](Images/installngix.png)

Step 3: Verify if nginx is running as a Service in the OS with the command 

sudo systemctl status nginx

A green dot shows that the server is running and the webserver was correctly launched in the cloud.

![](Images/verify.png)
![](Images/version.png)

Open Port 80
![](Images/Rules.png)

The server is running and can be accessed locally from the Internet (Source 0.0.0.0/0 means ‘from any IP address’).
The below command is used to check how it can be accessed locally in the Ubuntu shell.

$ curl http://localhost:80   
or 

$ curl http://127.0.0.1:80`

The above command typically produces same result, however, the first command accesses the server through the DNS name while the second command accessing the sever using an IP address (in this case IP address 127.0.0.1 corresponds to DNS name ‘localhost’ and the process of converting a DNS name to IP address is called “resolution”).

### Verification
After the port 80 is opened, the next step is to verify if Nginx server can recieve and respond to request from the internet. I used the puvlic IP address from the EC2 instance for the verification http://99.79.60.244

The image below shows that the webserver is installed and accessible

![](Images/NGINXSHOW.png)

### Now the LE components of "LEMP" stack is installed 


 ## Installing MySQL Database
 
 
The next component of the stack is # M- MySQL Database
 
## M- MySQL Database 
 
MySQL is a relational database management system based on SQL – Structured Query Language. The application is used for a wide range of purposes, including data warehousing, e-commerce, and logging applications. The most common use for mySQL however, is for the purpose of a web database. MySQL Database Service is a fully managed database service to deploy cloud-native applications and it is used within the PHP environment. Now that a webserve is running,a database management system is required for storing and managing data.

### Steps to installing MySQl

#### Step 1:

sudo apt install mysql-server

The above code is used to get and install mysql software
When prompted, confirm installation by typing Y, and then ENTER.

![](Images/installsql.png)


#### Step 2: Running Security Script

Best prectice after installation of mysql software is for security script to be run. The code 


$ sudo mysql_secure_installation

installs the security script and removes some insecure default settings and lock down access to the database system. 

##### N.B When the script is running, VALIDATE PASSWORD PLUGIN is asked.Enabling this feature is subjective. If enabled, passwords which don’t match the specified criteria will be rejected by MySQL with an error. However, It is safe to leave validation disabled, but a strong and unique passwords should always be used for database credentials.

![](Images/Validate.png)

For other questions I typed Y and hit the ENTER key at each prompt.This removes some anonymous users, the test database, disable remote root logins, and load these new rules so that MySQL immediately will accept the changes made.

![](Images/yes.png)

![](Images/Validate2.png)


#### Step 3 Testing 

I used the command 

$ sudo mysql

 to test if the database was installed properly and also to  test if MySQL consol can be logged into.

The ouput is 

![](Images/version.png)

#### Step 4  Exit MySql 

To exit MySQL I typed exit into the terminal 

mysql> exit

![](Images/exit.png)

Now the LEM components of the LEMP stack installed. 

The last component of the stack is P-PHP

## P- PHP

PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development.It is Fast, flexible and pragmatic, PHP powers everything from blogs to the most popular websites in the world. PHP is the component of the setup that will process code to display dynamic content to the end user. In addition to the php package, php-mysql, a PHP module that allows PHP to communicate with MySQL-based databases will be required. Also, libapache2-mod-php is needed to enable Apache to handle PHP files. Core PHP packages will automatically be installed as dependencies

To install PHP, 3 packages will be run at once using the command 

$ sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql

![](Images/installphp.png)

I entered Y when a prompt is asked for installation continuation and ENTER to confirm installation
![](Images/Confirmation.png)

####  Now the LEMP stacked installed.  

After installing the LEMP stack, I configured NGNIX to use the PHP Processor

### Configuring Nginx to Use PHP Processor
 Nginx web server can  be used  to create server blocks to encapsulate configuration details and host more than one domain on a single server.This is similar to virtual host in Apache. In this project, I used LEMPStack as the domain name. On Ubuntu 20.04, Nginx has one server block enabled by default and is configured to serve documents out of a directory at /var/www/html. While this works well for a single site, it can become difficult to manage if multiple sites are hosted. Instead of modifying /var/www/html, a new directory structure will be created within /var/www for the your_domain website, leaving /var/www/html in place as the default directory to be served if a client request does not match any other sites
The configuration steps includes

### Step 1: Create the root web directory for your_domain using
$ sudo mkdir /var/www/LEMPStack

### Step 2: Assign ownership of the directory with the $USER environment variable, which will reference your current system user using

$ sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/LEMPStack

### Step 3 : Open a new configuration file in Nginx’s `sites-available` directory using `nano`

`$ sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/LEMPStack`

This will create a new blank file on the terminal and the code w. Paste in the following bare-bones configuration:

`#/etc/nginx/sites-available/projectLEMP

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name projectLEMP www.projectLEMP;
    root /var/www/projectLEMP;

    index index.html index.htm index.php;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
     }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }

}`

![](Images/LEMPStack.png)

![](Images/Config.png)
They code above means:

- `listen` — Defines what port Nginx will listen on. In this case, it will listen on port `80`, the default port for HTTP.
- `root` — Defines the document root where the files served by this website are stored.
- `index`— Defines in which order Nginx will prioritize index files for this website. It is a common practice to list `index.html` files with a higher precedence than `index.php` files to allow for quickly setting up a maintenance landing page in PHP applications. You can adjust these settings to better suit your application needs.
- 
- `server_name` — Defines which domain names and/or IP addresses this server block should respond to i.e.
#### Point this directive to the server’s domain name or public IP address.
- `location /` — The first location block includes a `try_files` directive, which checks for the existence of files or directories matching a URI request. If Nginx cannot find the appropriate resource, it will return a 404 error.
- `location ~ \.php$` — This location block handles the actual PHP processing by pointing Nginx to the fastcgi-php.conf configuration file and the `php7.4-fpm.sock file`, which declares what socket is associated with `php-fpm`.
- `location ~ /\.ht`— The last location block deals with `.htaccess` files, which Nginx does not process. By adding the deny all directive, if any `.htaccess` files happen to find their way into the document root ,they will not be served to visitors.
### Step 4 Activate configuration by linking the config file from Nginx’s sites-enabled directory using the command:

$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/projectLEMP /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

### Step 5 : Test Configuration for Syntax error
Test for Sybtax error using the command 

$ sudo nginx -t

![](Images/ok.png)

### Step 6: Disable default Nginx host that is currently configured to listen on port 80, for this run using the command

sudo unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

### Step 7: Apply Changes using the command 
$ sudo systemctl reload nginx
The new website is now active, but the web root /var/www/projectLEMP is still empty. 
so I created an index.html file in that location so I can test that the new server block works as expected using the command:

sudo echo 'Hello LEMP from hostname' $(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-hostname) 'with public IP' $(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4) > /var/www/LEMPStack/index.html

### Step 8: Website Verification
I opened the website URL using the IP address

http://Public-IP-Address:80
http://<Public-IP-Address>:80


![](Images/Website.png)

### I now have the LEMP stack fully configured. In the next steps, I will create a PHP script to test that Nginx is in fact able to handle .php files within the newly configured website.


## Testing PHP with Nginx
Now that the LAMP stack is completely installed and fully operational. Testing can be completed to validate that Nginx can correctly handle the  `.php` files off to the PHP processor.
This can be done by creating a test PHP file in the document root. 
 
To get this completed, I typed `info.php` into the new file  within the document root of the text editor 
 
### Accessing the webpage from the web browswer
 
The web page can be accessed using the domain name or public IP address that was set in the 
Nginx configuration file, followed by /info.php

`http://`server_domain_or_IP`/info.php`

![](Images/PHPUSE.png)

N.B : For privacy, I covered some contents in the page 

## Retrieving data from MySQL database with PHP
 
Before I started retrieving data from MySQL with PHP, I created a test database with a simple "To do list" and configured access so Nginx website would be able to query data from the DB and display the query.
Note: The native MySQL PHP library mysqlnd doesn’t support caching_sha2_authentication at the time of completing this project therfore  I used the default authentication method for MySQL 8. 
 
## Steps to create a test database
 
### Step 1 :Connected to the MySQL console using the root account using the command

$ sudo mysql

### Step 2: Created a new database and run the following command from your MySQL console:

mysql> CREATE DATABASE `example_database`;

### Step 3: Created a new user and granted them full privileges on the database
The following command created a new user named `example_user`, using mysql_native_password as default authentication method. I defined this user’s password as `password`, but this  should replaced to a secured password for security purposes.

mysql>  CREATE USER 'example_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';
### Step 4: Give user permission to "example_database" database using the command:

mysql> GRANT ALL ON example_database.* TO 'example_user'@'%';

This will give "example_user" the full privileges over the "example_database" database, while preventing this user from creating or modifying other databases on your server.

Now I exited the MySQL shell with:

`mysql> exit`
 
### Step 5: To test if the new user has the proper permissions, 
 
I logged in to the MySQL console again, this time using the custom user credentials:

`$ mysql -u example_user -p`

The `-p` flag in this command, gave the prompt for the password used when creating the `example_user` user. After logging in to the MySQL console, I confirmed that I had access to the `example_database` database using the command

![](Images/Login.png.png)

`mysql> SHOW DATABASES;`

output

![](Images/Show.png)

### Step 6 : Created a test table named todo_list. From the MySQL console, run the following statement:

CREATE TABLE example_database.todo_list ( mysql> item_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT, mysql> content VARCHAR(255), mysql> PRIMARY KEY(item_id) mysql> );

Note: I typed the above statment to prevent error output, if using this command typing is prevents getting back an error message

![](Images/create.png)

Step 7 : Inserted a few rows of content in the test table. I repeated the next command a few times, using different VALUES:

`mysql> INSERT INTO example_database.todo_list (content) VALUES ("My first important item");`

To confirm that the data was successfully saved to the table, I typed the below command:

`mysql>  SELECT * FROM example_database.todo_list;`
`mysql> INSERT INTO example_database.todo_list(content) VALUES ("My first Important Things to get completed in Six Months");`
`mysql> INSERT INTO example_database.todo_list(content) VALUES ("Attend Cloud Engineering Bootcamp");`
`mysql> INSERT INTO example_database.todo_list(content) VALUES ("Complete all Project");`
`mysql> INSERT INTO example_database.todo_list(content) VALUES ("AWS-SA Exam");`
`
![](Images/List.png)

To confirm that the data was successfully saved to the table, I typed:

mysql> SELECT * FROM example_database.todo_list;
And the output is shown below

![](Images/Complete.png)

After confirming that there is a  valid data in the test table, I exited the MySQL console using the command

`mysql> exit`
### Created a PHP script that will connect to MySQL and query for the content. 

To create a new PHP file in the custom web root directory . I used vi for that:

`$ vi/var/www/projectLEMP/todo_list.php`
![](Images/TODO.png)

 The below content was typed into the`todo_list.php` script:

`<?php
$user = "example_user";
$password = "password";
$database = "example_database";
$table = "todo_list";`
try {
  $db = new PDO("mysql:host=localhost;dbname=$database", $user, $password);
  echo "<h2>TODO</h2><ol>";
  foreach($db->query("SELECT content FROM $table") as $row) {
    echo "<li>" . $row['content'] . "</li>";
  }
  echo "</ol>";
} catch (PDOException $e) {
    print "Error!: " . $e->getMessage() . "<br/>";
    die();
}`

The file was saved and closed when editing was completed.

The web page can be accessed on the web brower by visiting the domain name or public IP address configured for your website, followed by `/todo_list.php:`

`http://<Public_domain_or_IP>/todo_list.php`

Output from web browser
